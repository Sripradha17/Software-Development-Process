      {
        text: "AI writes perfect code that never needs review",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "AI-generated code still requires human review, testing, and validation to ensure correctness and maintainability."
      },
      {
        text: "AI accelerates development by generating boilerplate code and suggesting implementations",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! AI can quickly generate repetitive code structures, suggest function implementations, and help with code completion, allowing developers to focus on complex logic."
      },
      {
        text: "AI eliminates the need for coding standards",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Coding standards remain important. AI can help enforce standards and suggest improvements, but consistency and readability are still crucial."
      },
      {
        text: "AI only works with specific programming languages",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Modern AI tools support multiple programming languages and can adapt to different coding styles and frameworks."

    question: "How does AI enhance code review processes?",
    options: [
      {
        text: "AI replaces human code reviewers entirely",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Human reviewers provide business context, architectural insight, and creative problem-solving that AI cannot replace."
      },
      {
        text: "AI can automatically detect bugs, security vulnerabilities, and suggest optimizations",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! AI can perform static analysis, identify common anti-patterns, detect security issues, and suggest performance improvements faster than manual review."
      },
      {
        text: "AI only checks syntax errors",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "AI code analysis goes beyond syntax to examine logic, security, performance, maintainability, and adherence to best practices."
      },
      {
        text: "AI makes testing unnecessary",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Testing remains essential. AI can help generate tests and identify edge cases, but comprehensive testing is still required."

  {
    question: "What role does AI play in debugging and troubleshooting?",
    options: [
      {
        text: "AI fixes all bugs automatically without human intervention",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "While AI can suggest fixes, understanding business logic and making appropriate corrections often requires human judgment."
      },
      {
        text: "AI can analyze error patterns, suggest root causes, and recommend debugging strategies",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! AI can process error logs, stack traces, and system metrics to identify patterns, suggest likely causes, and recommend debugging approaches."
      },
      {
        text: "AI only works with runtime errors",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "AI can assist with various types of issues including compile-time errors, logic bugs, performance problems, and integration issues."
      },
      {
        text: "AI makes error handling code unnecessary",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Proper error handling remains crucial. AI can help design better error handling strategies and identify edge cases to handle."
