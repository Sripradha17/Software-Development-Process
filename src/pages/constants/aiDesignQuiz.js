      {
        text: "AI can analyze user behavior data to suggest optimal layouts and interactions",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! AI can process heatmaps, click patterns, and user journey data to recommend design improvements that enhance user experience."
      },
      {
        text: "AI eliminates the need for user testing",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "User testing remains crucial. AI can help design better tests and analyze results, but real user feedback is irreplaceable."
      },
      {
        text: "AI only works for mobile app design",
        correct: false,

    question: "How can AI help with system architecture design?",
    options: [
      {
        text: "AI makes architectural decisions without human input",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Architectural decisions require human expertise, business understanding, and strategic thinking that AI cannot replace."
      },
      {
        text: "AI can suggest optimal patterns and identify potential bottlenecks based on system requirements",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! AI can analyze requirements, suggest proven architectural patterns, predict performance issues, and recommend scalable solutions."
      },
      {
        text: "AI only works with cloud architectures",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "AI can assist with various architectural approaches including on-premise, cloud, hybrid, and edge computing solutions."
      },
      {
        text: "AI eliminates the need for architecture documentation",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Documentation remains essential. AI can help generate and maintain documentation, but clear architectural communication is still vital."

    question: "What role does AI play in design pattern selection?",
    options: [
      {
        text: "AI randomly selects design patterns",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "AI makes informed suggestions based on analysis of requirements, not random selections."
      },
      {
        text: "AI analyzes project requirements to recommend appropriate design patterns and best practices",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! AI can match project characteristics with successful pattern implementations from similar projects to suggest optimal approaches."
      },
      {
        text: "AI creates entirely new design patterns",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "While AI might suggest novel approaches, proven design patterns exist for most scenarios and should be preferred for reliability."
      },
      {
        text: "AI makes design patterns obsolete",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Design patterns remain valuable. AI helps select and apply them more effectively based on specific project needs."
