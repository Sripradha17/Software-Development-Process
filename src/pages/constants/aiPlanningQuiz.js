      {
        text: "Enhanced data analysis and predictive insights for better planning decisions",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! AI can process vast amounts of historical data to provide insights, predict risks, and suggest optimal resource allocation."
      },
      {
        text: "AI eliminates the need for stakeholder input",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Stakeholder input remains crucial. AI helps organize and analyze this input, but human communication is still essential."
      },
      {
        text: "AI makes planning unnecessary",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "AI enhances planning processes but doesn't eliminate the need for thoughtful planning and strategy."

    question: "How can AI assist with project timeline estimation?",
    options: [
      {
        text: "By completely automating all scheduling tasks",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "AI assists with scheduling but human oversight and adjustment are still necessary for complex projects."
      },
      {
        text: "By analyzing historical project data to predict more accurate timelines",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! AI can analyze patterns from past projects, considering factors like team size, complexity, and scope to provide better time estimates."
      },
      {
        text: "By eliminating the need for buffer time",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Buffer time is still important. AI can help optimize it, but unexpected issues still require contingency planning."
      },
      {
        text: "By making all projects complete faster",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "AI improves planning accuracy but doesn't automatically speed up development work itself."

      {
        text: "AI identifies potential risks and suggests mitigation strategies based on patterns",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! AI can analyze project characteristics and historical data to flag potential risks and recommend proven mitigation approaches."
      },
      {
        text: "AI only works with technical risks",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "AI can help assess various types of risks including technical, resource, timeline, and market risks."
      },
      {
        text: "AI makes risk assessment unnecessary",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Risk assessment remains crucial. AI enhances the process by providing data-driven insights and comprehensive analysis."
