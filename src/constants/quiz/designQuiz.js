      {
        text: "Writing the actual code",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Code writing happens during the Implementation phase, not Design."
      },
      {
        text: "Creating the blueprint and architecture of the system",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! The Design phase focuses on creating detailed plans, architecture, and specifications for how the system will be built."
      },
      {
        text: "Testing the system for bugs",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Testing occurs after implementation to verify the system works correctly."

        correct: false,
        explanation: "Requirements gathering happens during the Analysis phase."

    question: "Which design principle emphasizes breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable components?",
    options: [
      {
        text: "Encapsulation",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Encapsulation is about hiding internal details, not breaking down complexity."
      },
      {
        text: "Modularity",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! Modularity involves dividing a system into separate, interchangeable components that can be developed and maintained independently."
      },
      {
        text: "Inheritance",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Inheritance is an object-oriented concept about deriving new classes from existing ones."
      },
      {
        text: "Polymorphism",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as instances of the same type."

    question: "What is the purpose of creating prototypes during the Design phase?",
    options: [
      {
        text: "To replace the final product",

        explanation: "Prototypes are not meant to replace the final product but to inform its development."
      },
      {
        text: "To validate design concepts and gather early feedback",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! Prototypes help validate design decisions, test user interactions, and gather feedback before full implementation."
      },
      {
        text: "To write production code faster",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Prototypes are typically quick, rough implementations focused on concept validation, not production code."

        text: "To complete the project early",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Prototypes are tools for learning and validation, not shortcuts to project completion."
