      {
        text: "Building new software from scratch",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Building new software is part of initial development, not maintenance."
      },
      {
        text: "Keeping the software functional and up-to-date after deployment",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! Maintenance involves fixing bugs, adding enhancements, adapting to changes, and ensuring continued operation."
      },
      {
        text: "Gathering initial requirements",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Initial requirements gathering happens during the Analysis phase."

    question: "Which type of maintenance involves fixing bugs found after deployment?",
    options: [
      {
        text: "Perfective maintenance",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Perfective maintenance involves improving performance or adding new features."
      },
      {
        text: "Corrective maintenance",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! Corrective maintenance specifically deals with fixing defects and bugs discovered after the software is in use."
      },
      {
        text: "Adaptive maintenance",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Adaptive maintenance involves modifying software to work in new or changed environments."
      },
      {
        text: "Preventive maintenance",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Preventive maintenance involves making changes to prevent future problems."

  {
    question: "Why is maintenance often the longest phase of the software lifecycle?",
    options: [
      {
        text: "Because developers work slower during maintenance",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Developer speed isn't the determining factor for maintenance duration."
      },
      {
        text: "Because software needs ongoing support throughout its useful life",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! Software typically operates for years after initial development, requiring continuous updates, bug fixes, and adaptations."
      },
      {
        text: "Because maintenance is unnecessarily complex",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Maintenance complexity varies, but the duration is primarily due to the software's operational lifespan."
      },
      {
        text: "Because it includes user training",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "While training may be part of maintenance activities, it's not the main reason for the phase's duration."
