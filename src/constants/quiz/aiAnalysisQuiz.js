    question: "How does AI enhance requirements analysis in software development?",
    options: [
      {
        text: "AI completely replaces business analysts",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "AI augments analysts' work but cannot replace human understanding of business context and stakeholder needs."
      },
      {
        text: "AI helps identify patterns, gaps, and conflicts in requirements automatically",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! AI can process large volumes of requirements documents, identify inconsistencies, suggest missing requirements, and flag potential conflicts."
      },
      {
        text: "AI only works with technical requirements",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "AI can assist with both functional and non-functional requirements, including business, technical, and user requirements."
      },
      {
        text: "AI makes stakeholder interviews unnecessary",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "Stakeholder communication remains essential. AI helps organize and analyze the information gathered from these interactions."
      }

    question: "What is a key benefit of using AI for user story analysis?",
    options: [
      {
        text: "AI writes all user stories automatically",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "While AI can suggest user stories, human input is needed to ensure they align with actual user needs and business goals."
      },
      {
        text: "AI can analyze user behavior data to suggest relevant user stories and acceptance criteria",
        correct: true,
        explanation: "Correct! AI can process user analytics, feedback, and usage patterns to identify common user journeys and suggest comprehensive user stories."
      },
      {
        text: "AI eliminates the need for user research",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "User research remains vital. AI helps analyze research data more efficiently and identify patterns humans might miss."
      },
      {
        text: "AI only works for technical user stories",
        correct: false,
        explanation: "AI can assist with all types of user stories, from business workflows to technical system requirements."
